# Utils for data science and machine learning in python.

The goal is to create a set of utilities that will make it easier to work with data science and machine learning projects in python. 

I want to work with uv package manager.

Create a pyproject.toml file. 
Create a gitignore file. 
Create good documentation.
Create example ipynb to show the usage of the utils.

## Utils for plotting in matplotlib and seaborn.

Create functions for common plotting tasks such as:
- Line plots
- Scatter plots
- Bar plots
- Histograms
- Density plots

Define standard, coloring styles for plots. Best in a config file.
Use German formatting for numbers, dates, etc. 
Add a corporate logo to the plots.


## Utils for machine learning performance evaluation

- Create a summary of common metrics for classification and regression tasks.
- Create functions to plot confusion matrices, ROC curves, precision-recall curves, etc.
- Create functions to visualize feature importance for different models.
- Create functions to visualize model performance over time (e.g., learning curves).


## Utils for cleaning

- use pyjanitor as a base
